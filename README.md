Modify JavaScript code to generate a random password 

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

I was able to get the prompt by myself but confused on what to do after that on processing the validating of the password criteria. First I used the link above to try and process and validate, but it was not working for me. 
I then seeked help via a tutor session with Jaun Santiago, he helped me with the character max & min, and explained Arrays a bit better to me. I continued to stuggle and visited Anthony our professor in office hours before class on Tuesday. He helped me get my validation started. From there i was able to get a password to generate but noticed it was not taking in capital letters and not making lowcase letters random. Then tutor mentioned that i was using the wrong variable and i was able to get everything to work correctly!

I stuggled a bit on this assignment and it was frustrating because i re-watched all the lectures before starting the assignment. I will try changing the way i take notes.

After this assignment, I have a better grasp on JavaScript. Just wish the activities were a bit closer to the assignments in difficulty, it would help attempting the assignments more.
